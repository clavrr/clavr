# Clavr: The OS for Productivity

## What is Clavr?

Clavr is an **AI assistant that gets things done** across all your work apps. Instead of switching between Gmail, Calendar, Slack, Notion, and Asana to complete tasks, you just tell Clavr what you need in plain English—and it handles the rest. It's the operating system for your productivity.

**Think of it as:** A super-capable executive assistant who knows all your tools and never forgets anything.

## Who is Clavr For?

**Busy professionals who:**
- Spend too much time jumping between apps
- Want to automate repetitive workflows
- Need an assistant that actually *takes action*, not just gives advice

**Perfect for:** Product Managers, Engineers, Executives, HR teams, Educators, and anyone managing complex work across multiple platforms.

## What Can Clavr Do?

### Talk Across All Your Apps
Give one instruction that spans multiple tools:
> "Find emails about the Q4 project, schedule a review meeting for next week, and create prep tasks in Asana"

Clavr figures out the steps, handles dependencies, and executes everything—across Gmail, Calendar, and Asana—automatically.

### Remember Everything
Clavr builds a memory of your work:
- **Knows your contacts:** Say "Schedule a meeting with Carol" and Clavr knows you mean carol@company.com
- **Connects the dots:** Links related emails, documents, and meetings together
- **Understands time:** Ask "What happened last week?" and get relevant context

### Stay Ahead of You
Unlike assistants that wait for commands, Clavr proactively helps:
- Surfaces relevant info before you ask
- Learns your patterns (e.g., "You usually create a task after client emails")
- Detects conflicts and opportunities
- Delivers daily briefings of what's ahead

### Learn Your Preferences
Clavr remembers things like:
- How you like your emails written
- Your typical meeting preferences
- Who your key contacts are

### Talk to It
Use voice commands for hands-free productivity:
- Real-time conversation
- Actions happen while you speak
- Works naturally like talking to an assistant

### Keep Your Data Safe
Enterprise-grade security built in:
- Protects against prompt injection attacks
- Keeps sensitive data private
- Tracks all actions for accountability
